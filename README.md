# friendFinder

Overview
In this activity, a "FriendFinder" application is built-- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

Express was used to handle routing. The app is deployed to Heroku here:
